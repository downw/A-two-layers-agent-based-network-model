# Introduction
We proposed a model: The health status subnet and the online social subnet. At each time step, the health status changes with a certain probability and moves to the next state, while panic-ridden emotion is transmitted through the online social subnetwork that functions as a scale-free network.
And then do the simulation.

## From the file textdata.rar, you can get

Relevant textual data generated by social media after case reports were published during the outbreak (from Weibo in China)

## from the file total-based_on_power-law.nlogo, you can

Appearing again How does the the total cases affect panic in Netlogo. It is Logo code.

This is the running pic:
